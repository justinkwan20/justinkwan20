## Hi there 👋
I'm recent grad 🎓 of the class of 2020 that enjoy's volunteering 🤝, cycling 🚲, and meeting new people 😊. <br> I inspire to give back to the computer science community and people who have supported me. For those new to my github the projects I showcase are some personal projects, hackathon projects, and school projects. Feel free to explore!
